<!-- For this assignment you will be creating three components

FirstComponent which is an h1 with the text "My very first component"
SecondComponent which is an h2 with the text "My second component"
NamedComponent which is a p that should accept a property of "name" and display the text "My name is " + name. Research props and how you can dynamically pass properties to your components
All of your components should be created with pure JavaScript and HTML. -->
